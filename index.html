    <p><em><b>software engineering student</b> </em><p>
        <p>3rd year <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering">software engineering</b></a> student with a passion for solving complex problems using technology.
             Proficient in Java, C, HTML, CSS, JS, and Python, I am eager to bring my technical skills and attention to detail to a dynamic and challenging work environment.
            In addition to my technical skills, I am fluent in English and Arabic,
             with basic proficiency in Turkish. As a proactive learner, 
             I am constantly exploring new technologies and seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.
            <br>
            I have experience volunteering as management staff with IBA2022 in Istanbul, 
            where I gained valuable experience in event management by successfully handling large events. 
            <br>
            This has allowed me to develop strong organizational, leadership, and communication skills and has further reinforced my passion for technology and its applications.
            
            I also have experience working with Damwa, a screen installation company based in Riyadh,
             where I contributed to a large project on Monshaat in 2020. 
             <br>
             This hands-on exposure to real-world projects has honed my technical and project management skills and has provided me with a unique perspective on the applications of technology.
            
            I am looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and organizations to explore potential opportunities. 
            If you would like to learn more about my experiences and goals, feel free to connect with me.
